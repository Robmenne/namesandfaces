## Configuring Analytics

On the settings page, there's a subsection in the Developers section for Analytics. From here, you can supply a URL and, optionally, authorization token for Explo to send information to and select the set of actions you want reported.

Note that the url must be formatted as a valid url with `http://` or `https://`.

## Analytics Data

When, for example, your dashboard is viewed from a Share link, Explo will send a request to the supplied URL with the following shape.

| Field      | Type   | Description                            |
| ---------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| user_id    | string | Id of the user who triggered the event |
| name       | string | The type of event triggered            |
| properties | json   | Metadata about the event               |

### Event Types
