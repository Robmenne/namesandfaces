## Connecting to different data sources

In order to connect to your database, you’ll need to gather some information about the database you want to use.

Some databases requires different sets of credentials in order for us to connect to them:

### Postgres, MySQL, Redshift, Azure, Microsoft SQL Server, Clickhouse

- The **hostname** of the server where your database lives

- The **port** the database server uses

- The **database name**

- The **username** you use for the database

- The **password** you use for the database

If you don’t have this information handy, the person responsible for administering the database should have it.

You may need to whitelist our Explo IP's `54.211.43.19`, `52.55.98.121`, `3.214.169.94`,and`54.156.141.148`

#### Finding Redshift Credentials

You can find your Redshift cluster details via the AWS console. The _Endpoint_ section gives you the hostname and port all in one. You'll need to get the database name and a username/password from whoever set up the Redshift cluster.

### BigQuery

- The **project id**

- The **JSON key** for that service account

#### Finding BigQuery Credentials

Create a Bigquery service user

1. In the Cloud Console, go to the **Create service account key** [page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey).

2. From the **Service account** list, select **New service account**.

3. In the **Service account name** field, enter a name.

4. 4. From the **Role** list, add the following roles
   1. BigQuery Job User
   1. 2. BigQuery Data Viewer
   1. 3. BigQuery Metadata Viewer

5. 5. Click **Create**. A JSON file that contains your key downloads to your computer.

The **Role** field affects which resources your service account can access in your project. You can revoke these roles or grant additional roles later. For more information, see [Granting, changing, and revoking access to resources](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access).

## Secure connections

If your database is behind a firewall, you will have to whitelist the following IPs `54.211.43.19`, `52.55.98.121`,` 3.214.169.94`, and `54.156.141.148`

To connect to your database via an SSH tunnel, you can provide us those credentials in the "Security" section of the connetion flow:

- SSH Server Hostname

- SSH Server Port

- SSH Username

- SSH RSA Key

- (optionally) SSH Local Bind Port

Please reach out to the Explo team at [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) if you have other security constraints.
