## What are Variables?

Variables are ways for you to create dynamic, parameterized versions of your dashboard based on who is viewing the dashboard.

You can find all the variables you have access to by selecting the icon in the top-middle of your screen and then "Variables" on the right tab.

Create and manage custom variables in the debugger panel by selecting "Variables" and "Manage Customer Variables"
