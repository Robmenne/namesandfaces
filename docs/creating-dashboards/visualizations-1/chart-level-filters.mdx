## Adding the Chart Level Filter

In a chart that supports color categorization, you can drag multiple columns into the color category. If more than one color exists, a dropdown will appear on the respective chart that the end user can use to switch between views.

You can also format the dropdown to appear either in the top right corner or below the title of the chart. The default placement is top right corner.

## Variable Usage

The selected item in the dropdown will be saved in a variable and can be used like any other variables across the dashboard.

In the SQL query, use the following syntax

```sql
WHERE 1=1

[[AND column_1 = {{<insert dataPanelId>.EXPLO_COLOR_CATEGORY}}]]
```
