### Segmenting user data

`{{user_group_id}}`

- The user group variable is a default variable that's already created in every dashboard.

- It is important to use this variable in every dataset that a panel is built off of if you want it to be customer specific. To configure this, select the field that has your customer's ID and set it equal to `{{user_group_id}}`

```sql Example
SELECT *

FROM table_1

[[WHERE user_id = {{user_group_id}}]]
```

### Additional operators

Variables can be used with other operators as well to achieve different filtering needs

```sql
--use the in operator when configuring a multi-select componenet

[[WHERE field1 in {{element1}}]]

--filter for similar values using like

[[WHERE field_3 LIKE '%' || {{element3}} || '%']]

--relative date and number operators

[[WHERE field_3 >= {{element3}}]]

```

### Improving query speed by filtering before joining

In general, it is best to filter tables before joining to other tables, by doing so, you can significantly cut down the calculation and query time needed to compute the entire query.

Example:

```sql Original Query
SELECT *

FROM models_operation

INNER JOIN models_flow

ON models_flow.resource_ptr_id = models_operation.flow_id

INNER JOIN models_datasource

ON models_datasource.id = models_operation.data_source_id

[[WHERE models_datasource.team_id = {{user_group_id }}]];
```

```sql Improved Query
SELECT *

FROM models_operation

INNER JOIN models_flow

ON models_flow.resource_ptr_id = models_operation.flow_id

INNER JOIN (SELECT *

FROM models_datasource

[[WHERE models_datasource.team_id = {{user_group_id }}]]

) AS ds

ON ds.id = models_operation.data_source_id;
```
