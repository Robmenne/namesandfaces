## What it does

This component allows you to group elements together on your dashboard. For example:

A container with 3 different charts inside of it

## Adding elements 

To add an element to a container, drag it in over the container. Only new elements may be added to a container. Existing elements cannot be moved into a container. Similarly, elements in a container cannot be dragged out of the container.
