Set the end date in include all data through the end of the day. Disabling will select data through the current time on that specific end date.

## Variable Usage

#### In the SQL dataset

To access the elements in the SQL editor, use the following syntax:

```sql
--to reference the first date

{{date_range_picker.startDate}}


--to reference the second date

{{date_range_picker.endDate}}
```

```sql Example
WHERE 1=1

[[AND date_field >= {{date_range_picker.startDate}}]]

[[AND date_field <= {{date_range_picker.endDate}}]]
```

#### In the panel configuration

You can also link the data range picker directly to a specific chart or table by configuring the filter section in the component edit mode without writing any SQL

1. Select the component you wish to filter

2. Drag a time or date field into the filter section

3. Select the operator "is between", the variable option, and the correct date range picker
