To create a new data panel, simply drag and drop the Data Panel V2 component onto the canvas. Once selected, you will see a **Data Tab** and a **Format Tab**.

#### Data Tab

The data tab is used to configure the visualization type and aggregations shown on the data panel. Choose between the different visualizations we offer below, select which fields to display, and set any data filters.

#### Format Tab

The format tab allows you to set specific formatting parameters for your visualization including labels, legends, axis settings, colors, and more. Note that the format tab will be different depending on the visualization that you choose.

For tables and maps, you will still need to use the V1 **Data Panel** component. We are currently in the process of migrating those over to the new V2 interface.

## Interactions

Once created, the new data panels have additional interactions that allow your customers to explore their data.

- Select which categories to display by clicking on the legend

- Zoom in and out of time series charts by selecting sections of the chart

- Hover over charts to view additional data

## Charts and Visualizations

### Standard Charts

Explo offers a number of charts including **bar charts, line charts, pie, and area charts**. Toggle between chart types to discover the best way to display your data.

**Configure the data**

1. Drag fields into the y and x-axis sections. These are the fields that you choose to group and aggregate the data by. Once dragged in, you will be able to select the calculation or grouping type.

2. (Optional) Add another field to the color section. This will further group your data by breaking your aggregation down by color.

3. (Optional) Add filters to your chart to exclude certain data.

**Format your chart**

Select the format tab to begin formatting your chart. Configurability depends on the chart type you selected. A few areas you can configure include:

- Titles and labels

- Text and number formats

- Legends

- Colors

### KPI Panel

KPI panels allow you to show single metrics to your user. Add an optional trend calculation to highlight an insight over time

**Configure the data**

1. Drag the field you want to display into the **Aggregation** section. Select any calculation to perform if necessary.

2. (Optional) Drag a date or time field into the **Trend** section to calculate a trend over a certain time period. This is great for showing insights such as monthly growth.

3. (Optional) Add filters to your chart to exclude certain data.

**Format your chart**

Select the format tab to begin formatting your KPI panel. A few areas you can configure include:

- Titles and labels

- Text and number formats

### Pivot Table

Pivot tables allow you to aggregate and transform your data into entirely new table visualization. Select the rows, columns, and aggregation for your table, and Explo will handle the rest.

Explo pivot tables are dynamic, so as opposed to transposing tables with hardcoded SQL, the tables will pull in the correct rows and columns based on the data.

#### Configure the data

1. Drag the fields you want to use to compute the columns and row groupings into the Columns and Rows sections.

2. Drag the field you want to use as your cell value into the Pivot Value section, select the correct aggregation.

3. (Optional) Add filters to your chart as if it were any other Explo visualization.

You can also select another table entirely to generate the column names for your table. Select "Join with another dataset" and choose a dataset and column to configure this behavior.

#### Format your table

Pivot tables have all the same format options you'd expect from the standard data table. Pivot tables also allow you to display and style a "Sum Row," which will compute the sums of each column in your pivot table and display that data in the top row.

Downloading data and filtering are also supported on pivot tables.
