title: "Error parsing Date/Time"
---

When building visualizations, you might encounter an error around trying to do a time operation on a date field:

> The query generated by this panel is attempted to do time operations on a date field. Please ensure that the field you are operating on has a time part before doing hour, minute, or second operations

This occurs when trying to group a date field by a time component (hour, minute, seconds). On some databases, this operation can only be done on a `DATETIME` or `TIMESTAMP` field.

An example configuration that could lead to this error

### How do I resolve this?

The easiest approach is to not use the time based grouping on this field. The `DATE` field doesn't contain time information anyways and so it won't provide much value to chart it that way.

Alternatively, you can look into your database or warehouse and see if you can convert the field to the necessary `DATETIME` or `TIMESTAMP` type.
