## What is an iFrame?

The HTML Inline Frame element (`<iframe>`) represents a nested browsing context, embedding another HTML page into the current one. You can read more about iFrames [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe).

## Where can I use the component?

Since the web component is an HTML element, you can use it in any context:

- Directly in an HTML file

- Define it in vanilla JS

- Any JS web framework: React, Vue, Angular, etc

## Constructing the iFrame Link

The iFrame is powered by an Explo URL that will need to be constructed.

`https://app.explo.co/iframe/<dashboard_id>/<user_group_token>/<environment>`

### URL Attributes

| user_group_token | string | The `user_group_token` is the token you use to identify the customer that is viewing the dashboard. This is retrieved via the End User Group API.                                    |
